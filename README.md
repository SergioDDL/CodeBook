## Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
 ## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
 ## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 ## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
 ## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
 ## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 




#Step 1: "Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set." 
 # read subject training data 
 
 
 subject_train = read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col.names=c("subject_id")) 
# this will assign row number as the values of ID column 


 subject_train <- as.numeric(rownames(subject_train))
 
 
 # this willread training data 
 X_train = read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt") 
 
 # this will assign row number as the values of ID column as required by the assignment
 X_train11 <- as.numeric(rownames(X_train)) 
 
 # this will read the activity training data 
 y_train = read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", col.names=c("activity_id"))  # max = 6 
 
 #y_train =  will merge(y_train, activity_labels) 
 # assign row number as the values of ID column which is discribed here having the numeric digits at the end.
 y_train22 <- as.numeric(rownames(y_train)) 
 
 # merge subject_train and y_train to train

 #this should work accordingly

 data2 <- data1[, c(c(1, 2, 3), selected_features$feature_id + 3) ] 
 

 
 
 
 #Step 3: "This portion Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and i am hoping it works." 
 activity_labels = read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col.names=c("activity_id", "activity_label"),)

 data3 = merge(data2, activity_labels) 
 

 
 
 
 #Step 4: "As asked this portion Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names."
